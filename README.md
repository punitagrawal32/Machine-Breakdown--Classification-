This dataset contains anonymized features, which are to be considered while building a classification engine which can predict if a 
machine will break down or not. 
This was done as a part of an assignment at INSOFE 

# Machine-Breakdown--Classification-
Predict which machine would break down next.  Dataset consists of anonymized features of machines environment. 
You must predict whether machine will breakdown. 
The data is collected from a fleet of machines of the same type. 

Each machine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user.
